      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Rich in Antioxidants</h2>
        <p>
          Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether
          as a matural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet
          treat. But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also
          been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal
          properties.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Natural Cough Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one
          study, it can also relieve coguhs more effectively than OTC
          medications that contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant.
          You can create your own remedy at home by mising up 2 teaspoons of
          honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Lowers Blood Pressure</h2>
        <p>
          Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and
          honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidants
          compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in
          both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure
          form consuming honey.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Improves cholesterol</h2>
        <p>
          Stduies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholestrol by
          6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may alos
          increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Improves Heart Health</h2>
        <p>
          It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids,
          which may support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's
          antioxidants could help improve cholestrol levels, which could help
          decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies
          are needed to confirm those findings.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="honey-benefits">
        <h2>Antibacterial properties</h2>
        <p>
          Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its
          antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can
          help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a
          low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing
          the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.

        I have been trying to embrace a more holistic life style and focusing on
        having a more natural, low preocessing and preservative diet. I have
        opted to reduce my sugar intake and change out to honey. I feel more
        assured that MTA honey valley is of the purest form as I have seen the
        GMPs employed by this company and have confidence in their ethical
        practices. I also used honey in my skin care routine and have been
        seeing big positive changes.
